<h2 id="question-1">Question 1:</h2>
<p>With each new release of JavaScript (i.e. EC2017, EC2018 etc.), different browsers implement new JavaScript functionality at different times (some faster than others). Sites like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> include a table at the bottom of a JavaScript reference page that shows which browsers have implemented the given functionality. Compilers such as <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> are used with libraries such as React that rely heavily on the new class syntax in newer versions of JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="question-2">Question 2:</h2>
<p>JavaScript code can be embedded in the HTML file between script tags or it can be written in external files with a <code>.js</code> extension and linked via the <code>src</code> attribute of a script tag. - A JavaScript statement is a command given to be executed in a script. A statement in JavaScript can be composed of expressions, operators and other statements. - A variable is like a box in which a value can be stored. In JavaScript, variables are declared with the <code>var</code> keyword and the <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> keywords in EC2016 and beyond. - An operator is a component of a programming language that performs a prescribed operation on one or more operands. Operators can be logical, comparison, arithmetic etc. An operator’s functionality is based in the data type of its operand(s). For example, arithmetic operators(i.e. +, -, /, *, %) cannot be used in the context of non-numerical data types.</p>
<h2 id="question-3">Question 3:</h2>
<p>A JavaScript function is a means of keeping code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). It is a mechanism for wrapping commonly used blocks of code in a reusable package. It can be invoked with or without arguments and can return values or not. Functions in JavaScript are first class, meaning that they can be passes as arguments to other function or treated the same as any other data structure. Functions in JavaScript are also objects.</p>
<h2 id="question-4">Question 4:</h2>
<ul>
<li>All three methods open a modal dialog box in the browser. All three methods also block other user interaction on a site until the user clicks a button.</li>
<li>The <code>alert()</code> method simply displays a message, while the confirm() and prompt() methods ask for user input.</li>
<li>The <code>confirm()</code> method returns a Boolean value that is contingent upon the user’s action. If the user clicks “ok”, a value of true is returned. If the user clicks “cancel”, a value of false is returned.</li>
<li>The <code>prompt()</code> method returns a string value for what the user types in the dialog box or null if the user clicks “cancel”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="question-5">Question 5:</h2>
<p>Three of the primitive datatypes in JavaScript are String, Number and Boolean. Strings represent collections of characters enclosed in quotation marks("" or ’’). Numbers represent integers and floating-point( or decimal numbers). Booleans represent the values true or false.</p>
